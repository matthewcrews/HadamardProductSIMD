# Hadamard Product with SIMD

This is a testbed for trying out the acceleration of taking the Hadamard Product of two data sets using SIMD. The current algorithm is the scalar version. As I learn assembly, SSE, and AVX I will try new approaches.

The StackOverflow question for approaches is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68884225/simd-instructions-to-accelerate-search-of-int-array).
